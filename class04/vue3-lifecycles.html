        Vue 3 has the same logical phases as Vue 2, but the preferred way is using Composition API lifecycle hooks instead of Options API methods.

ðŸ”¹ Vue 3 Lifecycle Phases & Hooks
1. Creation Phase

beforeCreate (legacy, not commonly used in Vue 3)

created (legacy, not commonly used in Vue 3)
ðŸ‘‰ In Vue 3, we usually donâ€™t rely on these; we use setup() instead, since it runs before the component is created.

2. Mounting Phase

onBeforeMount â†’ runs before the initial DOM render.

onMounted â†’ runs after the component is inserted into the DOM.

Best place for DOM-related logic (e.g., fetching data, initializing charts, focusing input).

3. Updating Phase (runs whenever reactive state changes)

onBeforeUpdate â†’ called before DOM re-render/patch.

onUpdated â†’ called after the DOM has been updated.

Best for watching or reacting to DOM updates.

4. Unmounting Phase

onBeforeUnmount â†’ runs before the component is unmounted.

Cleanup tasks: remove event listeners, cancel intervals, abort fetch requests.

onUnmounted â†’ runs after the component is removed from the DOM.

5. Other Specialized Hooks

onErrorCaptured() â†’ Captures errors from descendant components. Useful for error logging or displaying an error message.

onRenderTracked() (Dev-only) â†’ Runs when a reactive dependency is tracked. Useful for debugging which dependencies are causing re-renders.

onRenderTriggered() (Dev-only) â†’ Runs when a dependency change triggers a re-render. Helps identify what state change is causing an update.

onActivated() & onDeactivated() â†’ Used with `<KeepAlive>` components.
    - `onActivated` is called when a cached component is inserted into the DOM.
    - `onDeactivated` is called when it's removed.

onServerPrefetch() (SSR-only) â†’ An `async` hook that runs on the server before the component is rendered, allowing for data pre-fetching.
